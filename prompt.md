You are building TabKeys, a system-wide AI tab completion tool for macOS. Work incrementally, one task at a time.

Reference Files

ROADMAP.md - Task checklist (check off completed items) -- make one if none present in folder
DISCOVERY.md - Technical findings (add discoveries here) -- acts as a lookup map for finding things if we have already encountered them

IMPORTANT:

- check off only one item from roadmap on call and make sure to write and test meaninfully but not overcomplex, as this is to be made on mac, you can call me to test any features such as if the app asks for permissions or not. 

- Once you get an answer from me, put it in discovery.
